`fromAuthor` directory was cloned

````shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/youtube-tutorial-series.git
````

then renamed. `.git` directory was deleted as it was about 5MB.

Also directory `fromAuthor\demo-kubernetes-components\Slides` is about 5MB.
Need to clean it later if these files are not necessary for the course.

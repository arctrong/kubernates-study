`provided` directory was cloned

````shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/youtube-tutorial-series.git
````

then renamed. `.git` directory was deleted as it was about 5MB.

Also directory `provided\demo-kubernetes-components\Slides` was about 5MB and was deleted too.
I contained two files with `.key` extension. They are Apple Keynote Presentations and can be 
opened in LibreOffice Impress, but they contain nothing valuable. The content of this files
may be viewed by an archive program as they are actually ZIP-archives.

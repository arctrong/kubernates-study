__StatefulSet__ is used specifically for __stateful__ applications (like databases and other
applications that store data to keep track of its state).

__Stateless__ applications don't keep record of state and consider each request as completely new.
They may connect stateful application to forward their requests.

Stateless applications are deployed using Deployment components.

Stateful applications are deployed using __StatefulSet__ components.

The both components manage Pods based on container specification. The storage is configured the
same for both of them.

# Deployment vs StatefulSet

With a __stateless__ application:

- Pods are identical and interchangeable; 
- Pods are created in random order and with random IDs (hashes);
- the Service load balances to any Pod.

Replicating __stateful__ application is more difficult. It has different requirements. The
replica Pods:

- cannot be created/deleted at the same time;
- cannot be randomly addressed;
- are not identical and individual identity.

Here's how stateful application replication is done:

<a name="master_slave_pods"></a>

Master Pod can read and write while worker (slave) Pods can only read data. And after the master
changes data the workers don't read their storage before synchronization is done. If a new worker
Pod is added it clones its state from the previous (not any) Pod and then becomes available.
With this schema the data will survive even if all Pods die.

To make it work a Persistence Volume contains information about the Pod identity state (whether
it's a master or a slave). And it's important to use remote storage because the Pod may be
restored on the other Node and the storage must be accessible to it anyway.

StatefulSet Pods have fixed ordered names in format `${StatefulSet name}-${ordinal}`. The first
Pod is the master and the rest are the slaves in their start order. The next Pod is created if
the previous one is up and running. The Pod deletion is done in the reverse order and also
one by one.

<p><img src="pict/stateful-set-endpoints.png" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 25px 25px;" /></p>

A StatefulSet Pod has two endpoints. The first is the same as for a Deployment. The second is
DNS name in format `${pod name}.${governing service domain}`.

So when a Pod restarts the IP address changes but the endpoint stays the same. So Pod has
_sticky_ identity.
